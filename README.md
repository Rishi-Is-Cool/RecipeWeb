## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishi-Is-Cool/RecipeWeb.git
cd RecipeWeb
```

### 2. Backend (Flask API)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., `recipeweb_db`).
- Update your `.env` (or `config.py`) with DB credentials:
  ```
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=your_username
  DB_PASSWORD=your_password
  DB_NAME=recipeweb_db
  ```

- Run the backend:
  ```bash
  flask run
  ```
- Backend runs at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 3. Frontend (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
- Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

## 📂 API Endpoints (Examples)
- `GET /recipes` – Fetch all recipes  
- `GET /recipes/<id>` – Fetch a recipe by ID  
- `POST /recipes` – Add a new recipe  
- `PUT /recipes/<id>` – Update an existing recipe  
- `DELETE /recipes/<id>` – Delete a recipe  

---

## 🎮 Usage
Once both frontend and backend are running:
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the app.  
- Use search bar or categories to find recipes.  
- Add or update recipes through the UI (if enabled).
